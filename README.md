Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
It involves software product design,development,testing,deployment and maintenance.
It enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The development of programming languages e.g Fotran and C
The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960.
The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirents; Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design; Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation; Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing; Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment; Releasing the software to users and customers.
Maintenance; Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Agile is flexible and iterative, emphasizing continous feedback and adaptation while waterfall is sequential and rigid, with disntict phases completed in order.
Agile should be considered when requirements are unclear or expected to evolve, and waterfall is ideal if your projects has stable and clearly defined requirements that are unlikely to change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
a quality assurance engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
A project manager oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
They enhance productivity, collaboration and code quality by providing developers with features code editors.
Example of IDEs is Visual Studio and that of VCS is Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements, tight deadlines and technical debt.
Strategies for overcoming the challenges include; effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks and regular reassesment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing is testing individual components or modules of software.
Intergration testing is testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
System testing is testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance testing is testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
This is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.
It helps avoid getting confusing answers by making your questions clear and specific so the AI understands exactly what you need.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
An example of a vague prompt is ' tell me about cars' but to be effective you can prompt ' tell me about sports cars' The improved prompt is effective because AI will give you  a more specific answer other than the vagues prompt where the AI will give you a general answer about cars.
